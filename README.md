# Mercedes Benz Car Price Predictor

Overview

This project aims to predict the prices of Mercedes Benz cars based on various features such as model, year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, and other relevant attributes. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we seek to provide accurate price estimates for both buyers and sellers in the Mercedes Benz car market.

Features:
Data Collection: The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset containing information on various Mercedes Benz car models, including their specifications and historical prices.
Data Preprocessing: Prior to model training, the dataset undergoes preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Model Training: We employ machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest to train predictive models on the preprocessed data.
Model Evaluation: The performance of each trained model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2) to assess their accuracy and generalization capabilities.
Deployment: Once trained and validated, the best-performing model is deployed to provide real-time price predictions for Mercedes Benz cars.
User Interface: An intuitive user interface allows users to input the relevant features of a Mercedes Benz car and obtain an estimated price prediction.

Dependencies:

Python 3.x
Scikit-learn
Pandas
NumPy

Usage:

Data Preparation: Ensure that the dataset containing Mercedes Benz car information is available and properly formatted.
Data Preprocessing: Run the preprocessing script to clean, encode, and scale the data for model training.
Model Training: Choose the desired machine learning algorithm and train the model using the preprocessed data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.
